# Question 1#
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------#
'''
Write an algorithm to calculate the sample variance of a one-dimensional
array of numbers where the sample variance for an array containing
N items is defined by this equation:

S = 1/N (SumAll-from i=0 to N-1 with (xi - -x)^2)

Here −x is the mean (average) of the values in the array, and the summation
symbol Σ means to add up all the xi values as i varies from 0 to N – 1.

# Question 2

'''
Write an algorithm to calculate the sample standard deviation of a onedimensional
array of numbers where the sample standard deviation is
defi ned to be the square root of the sample variance.
'''



#------------------------------------------------------------------------------#

# Question 3

'''
Write an algorithm to fi nd the median of a sorted one-dimensional array.
(Be sure to handle arrays holding an even or odd number of items.)
'''




#------------------------------------------------------------------------------#

# Question 4

'''
The section “Removing Items” explained how to remove an item from a
linear array. Write the algorithm in pseudocode.
'''

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------#

# Question 5

'''
The triangular arrays discussed in this chapter are sometimes called “lower
triangular arrays” because the values are stored in the lower-left half of
the array. How would you modify that kind of array to produce an upper
triangular array with the values stored in the upper-right corner?
'''

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------#

# Question 6

'''
How would you modify the lower triangular arrays described in this
chapter to make an “upper-left” array where the entries are stored in the
upper-left half of the array? What is the relationship between row and
column for the entries in the array?
'''




#------------------------------------------------------------------------------#
# Question 7

'''
Suppose you defi ne the main diagonal of a rectangular (and nonsquare)
array to start in the upper-left corner and extend down and to the right
until it reaches the bottom or right edge of the array. Write an algorithm
that fi lls entries on or below the main diagonal with 1s and entries above
the main diagonal with 0s.
'''




#------------------------------------------------------------------------------#


# Question 8

'''
Consider the diagonal of a rectangular array that starts in the last column
of the fi rst row and extends left and down until it reaches the bottom or
left edge of the array. Write an algorithm that fi lls the entries on or above
the diagonal with 1s and entries below the diagonal with 0s.
'''





#------------------------------------------------------------------------------#

# Question 9

'''
Write an algorithm that fi lls each item in a rectangular array with the
distance from that entry to the nearest edge of the array.
'''




#------------------------------------------------------------------------------#

#Question 10

'''
*Generalize the method for building triangular arrays to build threedimensional
tetrahedral arrays that contain entries value[i, j, k] where
j ≤ i and k ≤ j. How would you continue to extend this method for even
higher dimensions?
'''


#------------------------------------------------------------------------------#

#Question 11

'''
How could you make a sparse triangular array?
'''

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------#

# Question 12

'''
 Write an algorithm that adds two triangular arrays.

'''


#------------------------------------------------------------------------------#

# Question 13

'''
 Write an algorithm that multiplies two triangular arrays.

'''



#------------------------------------------------------------------------------#


# Question 14

'''
The algorithm described for adding two sparse matrices is fairly highlevel.
Expand the algorithm to provide details in place of the instructions
inside the angle brackets (<>). (Hint: You may want to make a separate
CopyEntries method to copy entries from one list to another and a separate
AddEntries method to combine the entries in two rows with the same row
number.)
'''

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------#


# Question 15

'''
At a high level, write an algorithm that effi ciently multiplies two sparse
matrices that have default value 0.
