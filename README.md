Essential_Algorithms_Python
===========================

I started to gather implementations of some selected algorithms inside the Essential Algorithms: A Practical Approach to Computer Algorithms by Rod Stephens. 

Then I implement more algorithms from different sources. In my last project I am gathering Number Theoratical algorithms inside the [NumberTheory](https://github.com/eneskemalergin/Essential_Algorithms_Python/tree/master/Number%20Theory)
