Essential_Algorithms_Python
===========================

I started to gather implementations of some selected algorithms inside the Essential Algorithms: A Practical Approach to Computer Algorithms by Rod Stephens. 

Then I implement more algorithms from different sources. In my last project I am gathering Number Theoratical algorithms inside the [NumberTheory](https://github.com/eneskemalergin/Essential_Algorithms_Python/tree/master/Number%20Theory)

There is a numerical integration sample code in python showed in IPython. You can reach it from: [Numerical Integration](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/eneskemalergin/Essential_Algorithms_Python/blob/master/numInt.ipynb)

> If you copy and paste the codes here, you will most probably get an error. Most of the codes here works with additional codes and data structure. In this repo, I tried to gather the types and little hints about them
